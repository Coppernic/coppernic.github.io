### Agility, flexibility, proactive listening and innovation in the service of our clients


Ticket-control, remote meter-reading, issuing electronic citations on public highways, authenticating personal identities by comparing fingerprints with biometric passports, and supporting food safety by tracking livestock-rearing are all very different undertakings.

However, each of these activities is carried-out by operators in the field using remote communications technology. At Coppernic our mission is to design, test, manufacture, deploy and maintain bespoke appliances as a dedicated response to particular demands such as these â€“ both now and in the future.
